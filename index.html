    <h2>Home Page</h2>
    <p>This is the home page of our awesome website. Use the navigation menu to explore!</p>
    <p>Nothing much here at the moment, but it will receive updates whenever I can be bothered!</p>
    <p>Hope you enjoy your stay here. Please contact the maker of the website if you want the files as some kind of template.</p>
<p>Though I'm not sure why you'd want this. It kinda sucks.</p>
