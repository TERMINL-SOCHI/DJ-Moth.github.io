    <h1>The creation of this website.</h1>
    <p>On the 12th of March 2025, I created this website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was a fun project that I enjoyed working on.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>My thoughts on Web Design, Software Engineering, and Developing.</h3>
    <p>Honestly? It can be fun to watch your code work after spending ungodly hours typing it.</p>
        <p>but it would also be frustrating if it doesn't work.</p>
        <p>Because then you have to spend a long time looking for the bug, and fixing it without breaking the rest of your code.</p>
        <p>But hey, that's the fun of it. You get to learn from your mistakes and improve your skills.</p>
